# CODE / API
    # Use CMA Open Access API to extra a "highlight" based on user criteria from a CMA exhibition of the user's choosing
        # highlight examples -> [biggest, smallest, oldest, longest, ...]
        # exhibition must have at least 8 CMA-owned works
    # Use the API to find 5 artworks that are related by one or more criteria to create a "mini exhibition"
    # Set up a MongoDB Atlas API to store and persist the following data:
        # athena id
        # accession number
        # tombstone
        # image
        # any fields used for highlight / criteria
        # an identifier for the mini exhibition

    # How did you approach this problem and why you end up with the solution you did?
    # How long did it take you to complete?
    # How would you change your solution in order to scale it up to a web application where users can select an exhibition, highlight and similarity criteria, and receive results?
    # How would you set this up as a process that runs daily, with different results, and posts them to social media platforms via API?
